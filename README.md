learnpytorch.io hands-on Python coding exercises for AI Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains Colab notebooks of my Python code using PyTorch to build
image classification models.

All widgets have been removed from the notebooks so they would commit to GitHub.
For output still not displayable in GitHub, links to images or screenshots of the
output have been included below the cell.

The notebooks follow Daniel Bourke's hands-on course, Zero to Mastery Learn PyTorch
for Deep Learning.

The hands-on learning culminates in three milestone projects in notebooks 7 through 9.

The final two apps built in notebook 9 can be accessed at:
